# Kick.com Python API

This is a WIP project. There is currently no public API for Kick, so I am attempting to reverse engineer the website so create a Python API. You can see the [example.py](/example.py) to see how this is used.

The goal of this is to be able to create a custom chat bot with commands, like Twitch.

I haven't read any of the legal shit from Kick.com, but this is probably against some term of theirs. Just a warning before use.
